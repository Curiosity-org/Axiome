# Axiome

Axiome is a bridge which aims to connect Matrix and Discord in the most perfect manner.

We aim to support basic things such as messaging but we also want to support more advanced features such as moderation, polls.

To learn more about the project, [join us on the matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#axiome:envs.net) or [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/JNXR5T3sTr) (and join the Axiom post).
